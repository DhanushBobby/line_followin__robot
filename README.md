# Line Following Robot

The Line Following Robot is a project that utilizes an Arduino Uno to detect and follow a white line on a track. This robot is designed to autonomously traverse a path while maintaining its alignment with the white line, ensuring that it stays on course without deviating.

## Introduction

The Line Following Robot is programmed to detect a white line on the track and adjust its movement accordingly to stay on the line. It achieves this using sensors to sense the contrast between the line and the surface, making real-time decisions to keep itself aligned with the path.

## Technologies

- Arduino Uno
- C++ Programming Language

## Usage

1. Power on the Line Following Robot.
2. Place the robot on a track with a white line.
3. The robot's sensors will detect the white line and adjust its movements to stay on the line.
4. The robot will continue following the line until it reaches the end of the track.
